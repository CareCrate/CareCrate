In order to develop PantryPilot, there's a few steps that you must do. If you haven't already, head over to [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) to install it. 

> **Notice** Reqires Node.js 14.6.0 or newer.

> **Notice** This repository uses Nextjs. Click [here](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started) to learn more. 

After you have Node.js install, you should be able to download and run the repository from your machine. To do this, you must first download the repository to your machine via ``git clone git@github.com:CareCrate/PantryPilot.git`` or ``git clone https://github.com/CareCrate/PantryPilot.git``. Once you've installed, the repository to your machine, open the root folder in your favorite text editor. In order to run the repository in development mode, you'll have to ``cd`` into the ``carecrate`` directory. To do this, type ``cd carecrate``. Once you're in the correct directory, verify and then, type ``npm ci`` into the terminal. This allows ``npm``, a package manager, to install all required dependencies to your local machine. Once the packages have finished installing, type ``npm run dev`` to start the application in ``development mode``. To access the development website / webserver, head over to http://localhost:3000 . Any changes that you make while the app is running, will automatically push and reload the page. This includes any and all errors, console logs, etc.
